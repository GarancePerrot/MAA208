    "## Historical background\n",
    "André-Louis Cholesky (1875-1918), student at the école polytechnique (X1895), originally designed his method for solving linear problems for a problem emerging in the field of topography. He worked on triangulations to draw maps of different countries. \n",
    "\n",
    "A triangulation is of a set of triangles covering the domain to be mapped. To each node of this triangulation is associated its position and its altitude, which are required to draw the map. On the field, only distances and angles can be evaluated, the positions and the altitudes need to be computed based on these observations. One verifies that, using only the length of one side of a triangle and two of its angles, one may reconstruct all the others. To simplify, assuming that the lengths and angles are linear functions of positions and altitude, one rewrites this problem under the form \n",
    "\n",
    "$$A V = b$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $b$ is a vector of the lengths and angles observed, $A$ is a matrix, and $V$ is the vector of the exact positions and altitudes of the nodes that we seek.  \n",
    " \n",
    "However, in practice, the evaluations of lengths and angles can be inexact due to human or instrument inaccuracy. Thus, more evaluations are performed, e.g. evaluating all the angles and the lengths of all sides of a triangle. In the new problem $AV=b$, we have more data $b\\in\\mathbb{R}^M$ than unknowns $V\\in\\mathbb{R}^N$, i.e. $M>N$ and the matrix $A\\in\\mathbb{R}^{M \\times N}$ is rectangular. This problem does not have a solution in general (only if all observations agrees exactly with each others). Instead, we minimize the error $\\epsilon(V) = \\|A V - b\\|_2^2$, which has a solution. This solution satisfies the so-called normal equation \n",
